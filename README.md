# GettingAndCleaningDataProject
This is Kaushik's submission of Getting and cleaning Data Course Project. I used Rmd and knitr and so was able to get good documentation out of those tools. All steps are automated

1. run_analysis.R has all the R Code for this project
1. GettingAndCleaningData-Project-Codebook.Rmd is the R Markdown file which can be run using knitr to produce the 2 files below
1. GettingAndCleaningData-Project-Codebook.html has all the output of the running code
1. GettingAndCleaningData-Project-Codebook.md is the outputted Markdown file
2. fitnessSummary.txt is the tidy data set

GettingAndCleaningData-Project-Codebook.html is the **CodeBook**
fitnessSummary.txt is the **tidy data set**

It has 180 rows (30 subjects x 6 activities).
It has 42 columns
	1st column is the Subject/person whose readings are present
	2nd Column contains the activity they were performing
	3rd to 42nd column has mean values of readings

Readings are described in [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones]
